# Count

Count is a calculator app. It saves your calculations between sessions. Be careful - pressing "C" will delete your history. 

Count is a window into the JavaScript interpreter, so you can do things like define variables and perform operations using them. There are also custom functions, listed below. 

You can use Count in your web browser by visting count.fyi (this won't save your calculation history, though).
